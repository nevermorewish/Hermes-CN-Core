`hermes-agent-cn` is a Chinese community fork of [NousResearch/hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent). It tracks upstream while carrying a small, documented patch set for Chinese provider metadata, the Hermes desktop runtime, and Dashboard APIs used by [hermes-agent-cn-desktop](https://github.com/Eynzof/hermes-agent-cn-desktop).

This repository is not a clean-room reimplementation of Hermes Agent. It is a long-lived downstream fork that keeps upstream attribution, upstream licensing, and a clear maintenance path back to `NousResearch/hermes-agent`.

## What is different from upstream?

The fork-specific changes are documented in [FORK_NOTES.md](./FORK_NOTES.md). In short, this fork adds or maintains:

- **Chinese provider metadata** for Dashboard environment configuration, including ARK, Qianfan, Hunyuan, SiliconFlow, ModelScope, AI302, CompShare, and LongCat.
- **Dashboard endpoints used by the desktop client**, such as attachment uploads, workspace directory listing, MCP server summaries, and active profile read/write APIs.
- **SSE + POST gateway transport** for browser and desktop shells that prefer EventSource plus HTTP JSON-RPC over WebSocket-only transport.
- **Runtime release packaging** that builds signed PyInstaller artifacts consumed by `hermes-agent-cn-desktop`.
- **Fork maintenance automation** for upstream tracking, runtime release signing, lockfile checks, and supply-chain scanning.

If you want the official upstream project, use [NousResearch/hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent). If you want the Chinese community fork or the desktop runtime consumed by the CN desktop app, use this repository.

## Relationship to the desktop app

`hermes-agent-cn` is the runtime and Dashboard backend used by [Hermes Agent CN Desktop](https://github.com/Eynzof/hermes-agent-cn-desktop). The desktop app downloads signed runtime artifacts from this repository's GitHub Releases and runs the Dashboard locally.

Current runtime release:

- [`runtime-v0.14.0-cn.1`](https://github.com/Eynzof/hermes-agent-cn/releases/tag/runtime-v0.14.0-cn.1)

Runtime tags follow this pattern:

```text
runtime-v<upstream-version>-cn.<revision>
```

For example, `runtime-v0.14.0-cn.1` means the first CN runtime revision based on the Hermes Agent `0.14.0` line.

## Installation

The fork exposes the same `hermes` CLI entry point as upstream. Do not install upstream `hermes-agent` and this fork into the same Python environment.

Install from GitHub:

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/Eynzof/hermes-agent-cn.git"
```

For native Windows testing, the repository also includes the PowerShell installer at [`scripts/install.ps1`](./scripts/install.ps1):

```powershell
iex (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eynzof/hermes-agent-cn/main/scripts/install.ps1)
```

Then start Hermes:

```bash
hermes
```

For desktop users, the recommended path is to install the desktop client from [hermes-agent-cn-desktop releases](https://github.com/Eynzof/hermes-agent-cn-desktop/releases). The desktop app manages the runtime for you.

## Quick start

```bash
hermes              # Start the interactive CLI
hermes model        # Select an LLM provider and model
hermes tools        # Configure enabled tools
hermes config set   # Set individual config values
hermes gateway      # Start the messaging gateway
hermes setup        # Run the setup wizard
hermes update       # Update Hermes
hermes doctor       # Diagnose common issues
```

Upstream user documentation is available at [hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/). Fork-specific notes are kept in this repository.

## Skip the API-key collection — Nous Portal

Hermes works with whatever provider you want — that's not changing. But if you'd rather not collect five separate API keys for the model, web search, image generation, TTS, and a cloud browser, **[Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com)** covers all of them under one subscription:

- **300+ models** — pick any of them with `/model <name>`
- **Tool Gateway** — web search (Firecrawl), image generation (FAL), text-to-speech (OpenAI), cloud browser (Browser Use), all routed through your sub. No extra accounts.

One command from a fresh install:

```bash
hermes setup --portal
```

That logs you in via OAuth, sets Nous as your provider, and turns on the Tool Gateway. Check what's wired up any time with `hermes portal info`. Full details on the [Tool Gateway docs page](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/tool-gateway).

You can still bring your own keys per-tool whenever you want — the gateway is per-backend, not all-or-nothing.

## CLI vs Messaging Quick Reference

Hermes has two entry points: start the terminal UI with `hermes`, or run the gateway and talk to it from Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, or Email. Once you're in a conversation, many slash commands are shared across both interfaces.

| Interrupt current work         | `Ctrl+C` or send a new message                | `/stop` or send a new message                                                    |
| Platform-specific status       | `/platforms`                                  | `/status`, `/sethome`                                                            |

## Development setup

Clone the fork and install it in editable mode:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Eynzof/hermes-agent-cn.git
cd hermes-agent-cn

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[all,dev]"
```

If you use `uv`, this is also supported:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[all,dev]"
```

Run the main test suite:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -q --ignore=tests/integration --ignore=tests/e2e --tb=short -n auto
```

Run the Dashboard smoke check used by the fork maintainers:

```bash
hermes dashboard --no-open
```

Then verify the fork-only Dashboard APIs listed in [MAINTAINING.md](./MAINTAINING.md).

## Branch and release model

This fork uses `main` as the stable product branch for CN runtime releases.

- `origin/main` is the stable fork branch.
- `upstream/main` tracks `NousResearch/hermes-agent` and must be treated as read-only.
- `chore/sync-*` branches are used for upstream sync pull requests.
- `cn/P-xxx-*` branches are used for fork-specific patches.
- `upstream-pr/*` branches are clean branches based on upstream for official upstream PRs.
- `runtime-v*` tags publish signed runtime artifacts for the desktop client.

See [MAINTAINING.md](./MAINTAINING.md) for the full maintenance workflow.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Please keep these rules in mind:

1. Fork-specific behavioral changes should be documented in [FORK_NOTES.md](./FORK_NOTES.md).
2. Broadly useful fixes should be prepared as clean `upstream-pr/*` branches when possible.
3. Do not squash unrelated upstream syncs and CN fork patches together.
4. Do not include real API keys, user configs, local `.env` files, or private runtime signing keys.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [MAINTAINING.md](./MAINTAINING.md) before submitting larger changes.

## Security

Security-sensitive issues should not be reported in public issues. Please follow [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

Runtime release manifests are signed. The private signing key must only live in the repository secret `RUNTIME_SIGN_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM`; never commit it to the repository.

## License and attribution

This fork is licensed under the [MIT License](./LICENSE), inherited from upstream Hermes Agent.

Original project: [NousResearch/hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent). This fork preserves upstream attribution and documents fork-specific changes separately.
