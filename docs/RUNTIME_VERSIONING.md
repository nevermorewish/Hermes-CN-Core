# Runtime versioning

Hermes Agent CN desktop runtime releases use a two-part version so the desktop
can distinguish the upstream Hermes Agent kernel from the CN runtime package we
ship around it.

## Version shape

Runtime releases are tagged and published as:

```text
runtime-v<kernelVersion>-cn.<runtimeRevision>
```

Examples:

```text
runtime-v0.14.0-cn.1
runtime-v0.14.0-cn.2
runtime-v0.15.0-cn.1
```

The parts mean:

- `kernelVersion`: the Hermes Agent package version from `pyproject.toml`.
  This tracks the upstream-compatible agent kernel version, for example
  `0.14.0`.
- `runtimeFlavor`: the package flavor. This fork uses `cn`.
- `runtimeRevision`: the CN runtime package revision for that kernel version.
  It starts at `1` for each new `kernelVersion` and increments when we rebuild
  or patch the packaged runtime without changing the Hermes Agent kernel
  version.
- `runtimeVersion`: the full install/update identity:
  `<kernelVersion>-cn.<runtimeRevision>`.

When the kernel stays at `0.14.0` but we add PyInstaller hidden imports, fix a
packaging bug, rotate runtime assets, or patch desktop-specific integration, we
ship `0.14.0-cn.2`, `0.14.0-cn.3`, and so on. When the kernel moves to
`0.15.0`, the CN revision resets to `cn.1`.

## Manifest schema v2

Every release asset set includes one manifest per platform at:

```text
https://ai.fengchiyun.com/downloads/Hermes-CN-Core/runtime/stable/stable-<platform>-<arch>.json
```

The manifest is intentionally flat so GitHub Releases can host it directly.
Schema v2 is not compatible with the older pre-release manifests; the desktop
must reject anything that is not `schemaVersion: 2`.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "channel": "stable",
  "runtimeVersion": "0.14.0-cn.1",
  "kernelVersion": "0.14.0",
  "runtimeFlavor": "cn",
  "runtimeRevision": 1,
  "platform": "darwin",
  "arch": "arm64",
  "artifactUrl": "https://ai.fengchiyun.com/downloads/Hermes-CN-Core/runtime/releases/0.14.0-cn.1/hermes-agent-cn-runtime-darwin-arm64.zip",
  "sha256": "...",
  "signature": "...",
  "sourceRepo": "Eynzof/hermes-agent-cn",
  "sourceCommit": "...",
  "createdAt": "2026-05-19T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Signature payload

The Ed25519 signature covers the following fields, concatenated with `\n` in
this exact order:

```text
schemaVersion
channel
runtimeVersion
kernelVersion
runtimeFlavor
runtimeRevision
platform
arch
artifactUrl
sha256
sourceRepo
sourceCommit
```

Any change to that order must be made in both
`scripts/sign_runtime_manifest.py` and
`hermes-agent-cn-desktop/src/process/runtime.rs` in the same change.

## Cutting a runtime release

1. Make sure `[project].version` in `pyproject.toml` is the kernel version you
   intend to package.
2. Pick the next CN revision for that kernel version.
3. Create and push a tag:

   ```bash
   git tag runtime-v0.14.0-cn.1
   git push origin runtime-v0.14.0-cn.1
   ```

4. The `release-runtime` workflow validates that the tag's `kernelVersion`
   matches `pyproject.toml`, builds the platform runtimes, normalizes and
   Developer ID signs the macOS payload, writes schema v2 manifests, signs
   them, publishes all assets to the GitHub Release, and uploads the public
   runtime update feed to the Linux download server.

Do not reuse a tag for a rebuilt runtime. Publish a new `cn.N` revision instead.
